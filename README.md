# datashare-plugin-email-filter
On [Datashare](https://datashare.icij.org/), add a new filter about emails addresses.

Please read the [documentation](https://github.com/ICIJ/datashare/wiki/Client-%E2%80%BA-Table-of-Content#filters) about how to add a new filter.

And do not forget to [extract email addresses](https://icij.gitbook.io/datashare/all/analyze-documents#extract-email-addresses) to fill your filter.
